Run "./build.sh" to build a new d3.js project.
- The script asks for a title, description and d3.js script file (in /d3 folder).

Run "./launch.sh [name]" to launch the [name] d3.js project.
- Supply the name of the project as the parameter to the command.

Run "./delete.sh [name]" to delete the [name] d3.js project.
- Supply the name of the project as the parameter to the command.

On my local machine I have set up aliases (see 'zshrc_file') for build, launch and delete, so I only need to run:

  build
  launch [name]
  delete [name]
